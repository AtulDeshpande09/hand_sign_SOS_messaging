# Automated SOS Messaging (with Location) using Computer Vision

## Description
This project implements a computer vision-based solution for sending SOS messages with location information.
It recognizes the viral TikTok hand sign for 'help' using computer vision and sends a message containing the device's location based on IP address.
The location is marked on a website (localhost) and the message includes a link to the location.
